## This site has been many things. Now it's a blog again.

Hey! I'm Cody Wilson. I've used the belthesar psuedonym for over half of my life, and for most of my digital life. This is a place for me to share thoughts in a more permanent format. You'll finds things about tech, video games, music production, and maybe random musings about life, leading teams, and building platforms.
